    <p> You decide to take the left path which eventually led to a forest. FriedSieg says that this
        forest is called SpiritWood and that we need to be careful once we are inside. "Can't we walk back
        and take the right path?" you ask, trembling. </p>

    <p> FriedSieg merely replied, "Conscience does make cowards of us all. Let's go." </p>

    <p> "But you said that I am going to be in charge of the adventure." you said back. </p>

    <p> "Yea, you chose to come down this path. So we must complete it to the end." answered FriedSieg. He went
        inside of the forest, forcing you to follow. SpiritWood isn't was dim as you expected. It was really bright
        and there was a path that led outside. In the corner of your eye, you see two strangers step out of nowhere
        with a cave and house suddenly materializing behind them. Funnily enough, they spawned right in front of a
        dragon
        and are forced to flee.
    </p>

    <p> Eventually, you are met with your own misfortune when a swarm of elvish hunters suddenly appeared in front of
        you.
        "What should we do?" you mumbled to FriedSieg.
    </p>

    <p> "That's for you to decide," FriedSieg mumbled back. What an useless mentor. </p>
