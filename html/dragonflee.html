  <p> You chicken out and you turn around and flee while FriedSieg continues onward. 
  He seems to be oblivious to the fact that you left him. You hear the flapping of wings and
  a scream behind you, but you didn't turn back. Your life is more important than human contact
  and friendship. </p>

  <p> You spend the rest of your life in hiding and wandering. You are able to avoid 
  the dark lord and your goons for several years before you got caught. In order to continue 
  living, you join the likes of the dark lord and participate in his orders. </p>

  <p> Soon enough, the entire population is wiped out: the elves that live in SpiritWood to 
  all the people of the towns. In the end, you forget everything you had worked for in the past.
  In the end, there is nothing left but darkness and the evil empire.</p>
