    <p> The two of you charge in, but the dragon is smart enough to stay out of reach of your swords.
  You pull out your bow and arrows, but your aim is terrible. FriedSieg came up with the stupid idea of throwing 
    you in the dragon, but you doubt if he is strong enough. He picks up and throws you
    at the dragon. This somehow works as it catches the dragon by surpise. </p>

    <p> You land on top of the dragon's head and you promptly stab your sword 
    into both the dragon's eyes. The dragon howls in pain and falls to the floor. The dragon
    has been slain. The bad news is that the dragon fell on where FriedSieg should be.</p>

    <p> You quickly get the gigantic corpse and look for your friend. You are able to find him next to the
    dragon's tail, shivering. The two of you hug and go back to Country to tell the town the good news. The next few
    days are all celebration and you live the rest of your days with plenty of human contact and in splendor. </p>
