    <p> The two of you decide to go the tavern, because there had been rumors that the bartender is able
        to serve up drinks that has random effects. The bartender doesn't seem to control what effects the
        drink gives. It can either give you a stat increase or a decrease.  </p>

    <p> You walk inside of the bar and the bartender promptly delivers you a drink. Now, you can decide whether or not
        you
        are going to drink it. If you don't choose to drink it, we are move on to the dragon fight. Otherwise, good
        luck. </p>
