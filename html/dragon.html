  <p> You and FriedSieg are given supplies such as armor and weapons to help
  you slay the dragon. As the two of you prepared to leave Country, a crowd has gathered along 
  the gate to wish you luck. You thank the town for everything even though you haven't stayed in the town much.
  And you begin your walk to the mountain where the terrible dragon resided.</p>

  <p> The road there was pretty short. A few minutes of walking and you are able to see the tip of your
  destination. When you got close to the mountain, you see a clutter of apple trees. They look so ripe enough to 
  eat, but FriedSieg prevented you in doing so. "Focus on your quest. Who knows what the apples 
  have in them," said FriedSieg. </p>

  <p> Suddenly , you see a enormous red creature perching on the mountain. You are the end of your journey. You die 
  or you live. The dragon looked ferocious and way to big to be slain. You begin to doubt your abilty to kill it. </p>
