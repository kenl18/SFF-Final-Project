  <p> The two of you charge in, but the dragon is smart enough to stay out of reach of your swords.
  You pull out your bow and arrows, but your aim is terrible. The dragon uses his gigantic claws
  and swipe you and FriedSieg off your feet. Then, you guys get stomped on. Over 
  and over again, as if the dragon is toying with you. </p>

  <p> You feel your bones crack under the weight, but somehow your skull hasn't been 
  crushed yet. You look over at FriedSieg, and his head is nothing but a pancake. He is dead
  and you are going to be too. </p>

  <p> Suddenly, the dragon stopped his onslaught. But it is for the worst. 
  He slowly lowers his head and picks up FriedSieg's lifeless body and swallows him whole.
  Then he does the same to you. Too bad you are alive, as you experience more pain as the teeth 
  rip through your entire body. You are dead. Maybe if you are stronger. </p>
