    <p> You decide to head to town. It's been a while, since you went there. To be precise,
        it has been a decade since you last had to go there. Hopefully, you remember the route,
        especially since there isn't a single path imprinted into the ground. </p>

    <p> It is almost afternoon, and you hope to go to town and back by nightfall. You decide to
        walk north which is where Outskirts was located if your memory served you right. You walked
        for one hour in a straight line, but encountered absolutely nothing. Questioning your instincts,
        you decided to wander aimlessly in all directions. Ten steps forward, make a 57 degrees turn to the left.
        Walk twenty steps forward, turn 23 degrees to the left. Walk some more. </p>

    <p> Somehow you found a town. You don't know if its Outskirts, but it doesn't matter. It was
        getting too dark outside and you needed a place to stay. Hopefully, sleeping in the streets
        would be safe. As you walked down the road, looking for a relatively a good place to sleep, you see
        a salesman with his back turned to his goods. </p>

    <p> You have the opportunity to swipe a basket of fruits and a jug of water off the table without him noticing.
        You are really thirsty and hungry from walkin too much under the harsh heat. Would you do it? </p>
