    <p> You decide to take hunting even though you know that hunting take luck. Considering that you don't have any
        tools in your disposal. You decide whether or not
        you are going to hunt for small animals in the forest up north or fish in the ocean to the east. It is much more
        dangerous to enter the forest, because you don't
        know what kind of creatures are inside there. There could be a tiger or something else you know not of. Finding
        a fish just takes luck. You can just trap it once you find it.
        Hopefully. Or that's what you think would be the gameplan. </p>

    <p> No further ado. Time to get going. The walk to the ocean should just be a straight path. You walk for an hour to
        the east without seeing a single trace of blue. You were getting
        more and more tired as the sun started to dip closer to the horizon. Soon enough, it was dark outside and you
        couldn't see an inch in front of you. You
        continue hobbling in the dark until you felt some thing cold washed over your feet. It's water. You had finally
        reached the ocean. You begin to drink the saltwater, as you were
        terribly thirstly. It was too salty for your taste, but it should suffice. For now. You fall asleep to the sound
        of waves
        crashing onto the beach. </p>

    <p> You woke up gasping for air, because you had been sinking in the water. Apparently, you have fallen asleep near
        the waves and it had carried you a few meters out to sea. Being wet was
        a pain to deal with, but you had to get a fire started. You scavenge for some wood and, by surprise, found
        something that could work as a pot. Let the hunt begin. </p>
