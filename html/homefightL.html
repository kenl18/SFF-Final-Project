    <p> You decide to also charge at FriedSieg, but that is an amateur move. He was able to grab you by
        the arm and smash you on the floor. FriedSieg did it so much force, that it created a crater onto 
        the floor of your house. You feel as if every bone in your body has been broken and you have been
        rendered immobile. </p>

    <p> FriedSieg begin to raid your house, taking everything that is of use to him. "Stop," you say, still 
        unable to move. </p>

    <p> "You are going to die anyway. It is foolish of you to challenge me." said FriedSieg. You truly feel 
        like you were going to die. Maybe, you are going to die. Suddenly, the idea of death washed over you. 
        What is there after death. Is there truly nothing? It is the undiscovered cuntry after where no traveler 
        is ever going to return. What if FriedSieg is a traveler that returns from death? Maybe this is what makes
        him so strong. </p>

    <p> You were unable to think any further, as you begin to lose conscious. You are going to die. "Damn you" was
        your last two words. And "If only I allowed him to stay" was your last thought. Good night. </p>
