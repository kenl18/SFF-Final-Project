    <p> It's too risky to open the door. The knocking seem to much more violent compared to FriedSieg. As the knocking
        sound turn
        into the sound of someone pressing their weight against the door, you start to get worried. You decide to stand
        by the door and cover yourself
        with your bedsheet. Eventually, the door comes crashing down and footsteps can be heard walking inside. You take
        this opportunity to run out the door.
        This miraculously worked, but it didn't stop the strangers from chasing you. You throw your bedsheet at them,
        hoping to buy time. </p>

    <p> Somehow, the bedsheet did more than that. The wind blew the cloth to wrap around the two pursuers' head. They
        fell
        head-first into the ground and struggled to get whatever blinded them off their forehead. You feel a sense of
        regret, because
        you couldn't turn around and laugh at them. You start to run south, although you don't know what lies in that
        direction.
        You can only pray. </p>
