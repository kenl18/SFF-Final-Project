    <p> It's too risky to open the door. The knocking seem to much more violent compared to FriedSieg. As the knocking
        sound turn
        into the sound of someone pressing their weight against the door, you start to get worried. You decide to stand
        by the door and cover yourself
        with your bedsheet. Eventually, the door comes crashing down and footsteps can be heard walking inside. You take
        this opportunity to run out the door.
        This miraculously worked, but it didn't stop the strangers from chasing you. You throw your bedsheet at them,
        hoping to buy time. </p>

    <p> Somehow, the bedsheet did more than that. The wind blew the cloth to wrap around the two pursuers' head. They
        fell
        head-first into the ground and struggled to get whatever blinded them off their forehead. You feel a sense of
        regret, because
        you couldn't turn around and laugh at them. But now is not the time. You start to run south, although you don't
        know what lies in that
        direction.
        You can only pray. </p>





    <p> Well. Godly intervention would help a lot as your pursuers is still behind you. You had been running for more
        than 30 minutes and you feel
        like you can't run anymore. </p>





    <p> Wait. Maybe it did work. 10 minutes is all it took, apparently. There seems to be something in the distance. You
        begin to speed up, as this sight
        gaven you a burst of energy. 5 minutes later, it turns out the thing you saw was a mountain. Without thinking, you begin 
        to scale the mountain. It seems to be much easier than running. After a while, you crane your head downwards. 
        Your pursuers was standing at the bottom of the mountain, not wanting to climb after you. While doing so, you lose your grip 
        and you fall downwards. Luckily for you, you land on your head causing you to die instantly. Well, it is unfortunate that you 
        died, but this is better than getting stabbed a couple of times. </p>
