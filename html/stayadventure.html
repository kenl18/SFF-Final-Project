    <p> Despite wanting to follow FriedSieg, you chickened out. You decide to stay home and continue to tend for it.
        As you were preparing dinner, you begin to regret your decision. This feeling was very much prominent
        in the next couple of days as the monotonous grind of everyday life was finally getting to you. </p>

    <p> You have no idea where FriedSieg was headed to and you deeply wish you had ask right before you left.
        You've debated whether or not to head off on an adventure to find him, but the thought of getting lost
        kept you from doing it. </p>

    <p> Eventually, a terrible thought enters your mind. "I would have been satisfied with my current lifestyle if
        I had never open that door. Why did I choose to open the door?" The next few days were filled with agony. You
        were
        busy throwing tantrums to pass time and lamenting about the past. But the past cannot be changed and you had
        quite the mixed feeling about that. </p>

    <p> One day by a curious chance, there are knocks at your door. You hastily jump up and walk to the door. As you
        are
        about to turn your door knob you pause. Is this contact going to be worth it or is it going to be devastating
        like last time? </p>
