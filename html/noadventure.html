    <p> "I'm sorry, but I have to decline your offer. This place can not take care of itself after all," you replY.
    </p>

    <p> "Very well," answeS FriedSieg. "However, you must know what times are changing. After all, this storm is a
        perfect example of that. If you don't know it already, it is no longer a time of peace.
        You must do your part in this to restore this balance. You did provide me valuable assistance.
        It is quite a shame you are unable to go on this adventure with me. With that, hope you have a undisturbed
        life." </p>

    <p> FriedSieg briskly walkS out of your house with the lighest of foot step. You begin to feel a great lump of
        regret within yourself.
        It was the only human contact that you have had in years, but you HAVE this feeling that you would see
        others very soon. Perhaps too soon. Nevertheless, you have the ability to catch up to him and join him. </p>

    <p> But are you going to do it?</p>
