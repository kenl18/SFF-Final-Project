    <p> You quickly reply, "I would love to go on an adventure on you." This was your answer simply
        because of the innate desire for human contact. There was nothing else that played a role in this decision.
        Other than ... Maybe ... You were getting tired of your current life </p>

    <p> "Excellent. It is very soothing to have another companion on this adventure. I will
        tell you of main objective as we get on the road. But firstly, I must tell you. This adventure is now yours.
        Entirely in your hand. You are now the protagonist and I am now the mentor or companion," FriedSieg said.</p>

    <p> His words seem to fill you with a sense of destiny. You seem to feel stronger. Stronger, indeed.
        The addition of FriedSieg as an companion increases all your stats by one. Keep in mind, you can only have
        one companion at a time. So if you encounter another person, you must abandon FriedSieg. What another companion
        provide
        is simply a mystery, but it can be decoded with higher intelligence. </p>

    <p> You begin to take everything from your house and packing it up for an adventure. The packing took
        all morning. The two of you embarked on your journey and headed west at high noon. Soon enough, you encounter
        a fork in the road. "Which path should we take," asked FriedSieg. </p>
