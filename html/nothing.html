    <p> Chasing after the thief would be too risky. There is nothing left inside of your house to
        bring with you: no food, no water. Nothing. You need to get find a source of food and water
        in order to survive. Hunting seem to be the best bet, but you live in a plain biome. To hunt, you
        would have to walk for an hour to each the ocean or the forest.
    </p>

    <p> Or you can try to go to the nearest town, Outskirts. You have no money to buy anything, because
        that too has been robbed. Your only hopes of getting supplies from Outskirts is to either
        rob or try to convince the seller that you were going to pay him back. A moral dilemma. </p>

    <p> You didn't think much of it as you will make the decision when the time comes. Firstly, you must
        decide whether to go hunting or to town. What would you do? </p>
