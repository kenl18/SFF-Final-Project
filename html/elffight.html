    <p> You quickly say to FriedSieg that we are going to battle with them. FriedSieg quickly
        nodded to show his sense of approval. As you quickly prepared to fight, the dragon that you saw earlier just
        coming towards you.
        You push FriedSieg out of harms way when the dragon unleashed his fiery breath upon the elven troop. They are
        scorched
        and dead in seconds. </p>

    <p> You being to prepare to fight the dragon, but FriedSieg say that the dragon hasn't noticed them at all. "We are
        going to fight a dragon later. Now is not the time." he says. Thw two of you sneak away while the dragon is busy
        munching away
        at the corpse of what used to be your capturers. </p>

    <p> Once we are out of the forest, FriedSieg later explain that we need to kill the dragon, because that is the dark
        lord's lifeline.
        The dark lord is too strong for us to kill, so apparenly slaying a dragon is much easier. Still a difficult
        task. </p>

    <p> You continue walking down the road until you find a town called Country. FriedSieg wants to visit one place in
        the town before we go to slay the dragon. The only noteworthy place to go is the tavern. So you decide whether
        to go there or not waste any time. </p>
