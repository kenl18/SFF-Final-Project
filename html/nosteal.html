    <p> Stealing is immoral, so you decided not to steal. You continue walking down
        the street, hoping to find a clean spot to lie down. Your eyelids begin to
        droop with each step. Eventually you sucuumb to exhaustion and you fell asleep
        in the middle of the street. </p>

    <p> While you weere busy snoring away, a raid happened at that particular town you were in. Desert bandits ,
        under the Dark Lord, ran through the roads, swinging their swords and stabbing everyone at sight. Including you
        when you
        were having a particular nice dream where you were a dragonslayer. But none of that matters now. You are a dead
        man.
    </p>

    <p> In the end, this entire town was burned and reduced to ashes. But this was simply beginning. More acts of
        terror and violence would plague this country. Too bad you didn't work to stop it.
        Maybe in your next life hopefully when this scenario repeats. </p>

    <p> This is the end of the road now. </p>
