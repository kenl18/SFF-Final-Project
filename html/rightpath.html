    <p> You decide to take the right path which leads you to a walk through a desert. During this walk, FriedSieg tells
        you about the main goal we are trying to achieve. "As you know, we are in a dark times. The weather have been
        weird lately.
        This is because a dark lord had risen to power. He plans to kill everyone and burn down everything to create a
        wasteland
        where he is allowed to govern." said FriedSieg. </p>

    <p> "If he kills everyone, who would he govern?" you interrupt FriedSieg. </p>

    <p> "His men. The people who are carrying out the killing and destruction for him. They are men in long cloaks that
        cover their face. The dark lord is basically unkillable. Or too hard to kill. Who knows. But one thing that
        we do know is that he is spiritually connected to a dragon. If the dragon dies, the dark lord also dies.
        Don't ask me how some people figured it out and others confirmed that it was true." FriedSieg continue saying.

    <p> "Ok. So the dark lord is dumb enough not to protect the dragon. We know the location of this creature and are
        heading there
        to kill it. Or attempt to kill it." you say. </p>

    <p> "That is correct." reply FriedSieg, just as the two of you are approaching a town called Country. FriedSieg
        wants to
        visit one place in
        the town before we go to slay the dragon. The only noteworthy place to go is the tavern. So you decide whether
        to go there or not waste any time. </p>
