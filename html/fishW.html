    <p> But firstly you need to get the fire started. You do the primative strategy of starting fire which worked after
        several attempts.
        Then, you waded into the water until the water was up to your chest. You took a deep breath and putted your head
        under water. Right in front of your face,
        was a decently sized fish for you to eat. You quickly clasp your hands around the fish. The fish tried to wiggle
        from your grasp, but it was unable to. </p>

    <p> You have secured food. But just to be safe, you decide to catch some more. At the end of the day, you caught a
        total of 13 fish. How lucky.
        You decide to cook the fish in water in hopes of getting a liquid that is more drinkable that saltwater. All
        that is left is to wait. You boil
        the fish for 30 minutes before eating it. The meat is relatively mushy and unseasoned, but it is a source of
        nutrients and food. Afterwards, you drank all the soup if
        it can be called that. </p>

    <p> You plan to go to town to trade your fish for supplies. You will do that when the sun rises or when you wake up.
        When you finally wake up in the morning, the sun
        is at its highest position in the sky. You boil another fish to eat as your source of food and drink before you
        head out. You put rest of fish in a pot and you begin
        to walk north. You walk north for about an hour before you start walking west. Eventually, you come to
        Outskirts. Or what remains of Outskirts. There is nothing, but the
        smell of burned wood and ashes. </p>

    <p> "What happened you?" you wondered. "Did it get burned down by evildoers? Luckily, I decided to go hunting for who knows
        what will happen to me if I chose to go to town earlier. I guess all that is left is to go back to the ocean. That is the only
        I survive." You use the remains of the village to start a fire to eat one of your fish and went to sleep. In the morning, you headed back
        to the ocean. You arrive back at the ocean to see a big ship. A pirate can be seen getting off of it. You quickly run up to him, asking him to join 
        his crew. He agrees, because he can always use more hands on deck. You enjoy your new life at sea. The End </p>
