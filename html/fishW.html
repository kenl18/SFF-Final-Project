    <p> But firstly you need to get the fire started. You do the primative strategy of starting fire which worked after several attempts. 
        Then, you waded into the water until the water was up to your chest. You took a deep breath and putted your head under water. Right in front of your face, 
        was a decently sized fish for you to eat. You quickly clasp your hands around the fish. The fish tried to wiggle from your grasp, but it was unable to. </p>

    <p> You have secured food. You decide to cook the fish in water in hopes of getting a liquid that is more drinkable that saltwater. All that is left is to wait. You boil
        the fish for 30 minutes before eating it. The meat is relatively mushy and unseasoned, but it is a source of nutrients and food. Afterwards, you drank all the soup if 
        it can be called that. </p>
