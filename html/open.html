    <p> You decide to take the risk and open the door. You open the door slowly in hopes
        of catching how the stranger looked. You couldn't make out the shape of the
        traveler, so you decided to open the door fully. Tears of cold rain slowly begin to enter and
        the hinge squeaked with each angle increase. When the door was open to its full glory, lightning
        flashed illuminating the silhouette of the dripping visitor. </p>

    <p> He was fully covered in a cloak that covered his face all the way down to his knees. The cloak
        was ragged as if it has stood the testament of time and precipitation. The traveler stood at the same
        height as you. He gave off a gentle aura: one that was seemed to be truthful in nature. </p>

    <p> You welcome this person inside, sat him down, and prepared a nice hot cup of tea to warm him up. When the
        stranger
        took off his cloak to drink, you were shocked by how young he looked. Perhaps, young and old can't seem to
        describe
        the stature of his face. His hair and beard, both white in color, were overgrown all over the place. Despite all
        this,
        his face was rather free of wrinkles, and looked regal indeed. </p>

    <p> "What brought you to be my place and why are you traveling in this kind of weather?" you asked. </p>

    <p> There was a moment of awkward silence as the mysterious person finished drinking the tea. He let out
        a sigh and began to talk. "Thank you. My name is FriedSieg and I'm on a quest. It's an important quest
        after all and I can't let a storm slow me down. Now that this tempest has escalated rather quickly,
        I politely ask for your hospitality." </p>

    <p> "What an interesting request that is. Should I allow it?" </p>
