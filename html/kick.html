    <p> There was a long moment of silence as you ponder this question. </p>

    <p> Eventually, you replied with your answer: "I'm afraid I don't have the resources to accommodate you." </p>

    <p> An angry expression begin to surface on FriedSieg's face as he yelled, "What do you mean by that? This place has plenty of space and food as I perceive of it.
        You merely dont want the burden of hospitality. You make me sick." He stood up, knocking everything on the table to the floor. The now empty cup of tea landed on 
        the floor with a loud *Crash*. To your surprise, FriedSieg was able to destroy the table and the chair with relative ease despite his physique. </p>

    <p> Then, he charged at you. He is looking to start a fight after all. Looks can be deceiving after all. What would you do? </p>

    <footer> The chances of success and failure aren't added yet. The fight option would have a chance of failure and success. Final copy would have 2 buttons</footer>
