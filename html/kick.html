    <p> There was a long moment of silence as you ponder this question. </p>

    <p> Eventually, you replied with your answer: "I'm afraid I don't have the resources to accommodate you." </p>

    <p> An angry expression begin to surface on FriedSieg's face as he yelled, "What do you mean by that? This place has
        plenty of space and food as I perceive of it.
        You merely dont want the burden of hospitality. You make me sick." He stood up, knocking everything on the table
        to the floor. The now empty cup of tea landed on
        the floor with a loud *Crash*. To your surprise, FriedSieg was able to destroy the table and the chair with
        relative ease despite his physique. </p>

    <p> Then, he charged at you. He is looking to start a fight after all. FriedSieg doesn't look that strong, but looks can be deceiving.  </p>
