    <p> You take a defensive stance and was able to grab FriedSieg by the arm. You flip him over your head and smash him onto the floor.
        You dont't even know your own strength that you create a crater in your house. "How?" you hear FriedSieg say before he dies instantly.
        That's too bad, you were unable to ask him any questions regarding the weird weather. At least you have something to do now. You spend
        the rest of your week fixing up your house. </p>
<p> One day by a curious chance, there was knocks at your door. You hastily jumped up and went to the door. As you
        were
        about to turn your door knob you paused. Is this contact going to be worth it or is it going to be devastating
        like last time? </p>
