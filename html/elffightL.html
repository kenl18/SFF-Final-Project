    <p> You quickly say to FriedSieg that we are going to battle with them. FriedSieg quickly
        nodded to show his sense of approval. The two of you charge at what you suppose to be
        the elf leader, but he was able to skillfully move out of the way. He brandishes a bow and 
        notches an arrow. With no hesitation, he shots it. It was directly towards you. </p>

    <p> FriedSieg sensing that your life is on the line, he jumps in front of you. The arrow impales 
        his heart and he dies instantly. The death of your friend even though your time with him is short-lived fills you with rage. 
        Once again, you charge at the leader of the group. Once again, he notches an arrow and shoots it at you. 
        You use your arm as a shield and continue your attack on him. </p>

    <p> The other elves also began to shoot at you. Arrows stabbed onto all area of your back, but it you didn't let it stop you. 
        You finally reach the leader and put him in an armchoke. Then, you twist his neck and you hear a loud
        cracking noise as your answer. The elven leader is dead, but it seems like you are too. You fall onto the floor, but as a last ditch 
        effort your crawl towards FriedSieg. You are able to put your hand onto his head just as you lose consciousness. It's over. </p>
