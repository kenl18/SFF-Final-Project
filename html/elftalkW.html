    <p> "O, great Elf Leader. You have to let us through. We are on a quest for the betterment of
        everyone in this land." you say with the most soothing voice you can possibly to. FriedSieg can
        be heard echoing your very word. </p>

    <p> "In what way are you improving our lives?" bellow the leader. </p>

    <p> "I'm sure you know that times are changing. We are living in a dark time indeed and I'm trying to fix that." you
        reply.
        To be honest, you are bluffing and have no idea what you are talking about. You agreed to go on an adventure
        with FriedSieg
        and you haven't been told what the mission you are trying to accomplish. A sweat can be seen surfacing
        on your head as you look at FriedSieg to help make a convincing argument. </p>

    <p> "Interesting. Tell me more," said the leader. </p>

    <p> You continue to stare at FriedSieg for help, but FriedSieg doesn't seem to get what you are trying to
        communicate.
        There is a long pause before FriedSieg begin to say: "We are on a quest to slay a dragon. Not just any dragon,
        but
        the one who the dark lord has his lifeline tied to. If we slay this dragon, this land will
        be free from purges." </p>

    <p> "And will be able to slay this beast?" question the interested elf. </p>

    <p> "We will try our best or die trying. If we die in the dragon fight, it doesn't matter to you. But
        if we do kill it, we are doing this nation a favor." you answer back. </p>

    <p> "Very well. It seems that you are telling the truth. To help you on this quest, I give you this ring. It will
        grant you this ring. It will grant you an extra point of intelligence and luck," the high elf reply. You thank
        him
        and make you way out of the SpiritWood. Following the path brings you to the town, Country. FriedSieg wants to
        visit one place in
        the town before we go to slay the dragon. The only noteworthy place to go is the tavern. So you decide whether
        to go there or not waste any time. </p>
