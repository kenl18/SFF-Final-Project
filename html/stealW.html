    <p> You swiftly snatched the basket of fruits off the table. Holding it close to your chest, you quickly darted out
        of view. Your stomach growled, begging you
        to eat the apples right away. One apple went down the drain. Then two. Soon enough, you ate the all of the
        apples. Satisfied, you moved out of your
        hiding place in time to see the salesperson get stabbed by a hooded figure. You stifled a noise, but the hooded
        figure turned toward you. </p>

    <p> You wished that you didn't leave your hiding space at all. But on second glance, the entire street was starting
        to catch on fire. You were going to die either way.
        Filled with adrenaline and energy, you started running as fast as you can. The hooded figure ran after you
        calling for support and people to cut you off. Two people showed
        up in front of you, both carrying swords. You make a sharp right turn and continue running. </p>

    <p> Whatever street you end up on. There is always going to be someone blocking your path. You were going to run out
        of options to escape. Luckily, you see the exit of the town.
        You started to speed up as a entire mob of people are running after you. Your legs are beginning to get tired,
        but the fear of dying was too great. Once you made it past the
        gate, the mob slowed down. You were homebound and you surprisely knew the route home. In fear that the cloaked
        figure would run after you, you kept up the pace. </p>

    <p> After half an hour, you collapsed on the floor. You forgot to drink water and your throat was parched. You begin
        to hallucinate, but you continue crawling. You didn't crawl
        far before you black out. You woke up in the morning to see a ghost. Questioning if you are hallucinating or
        not, you asked, "Are you real?" No reply. You felt as if your
        soul is getting sucked out of you. Soon enough, you were staring at your own body which in turn was staring back
        at you blankly. "Am I dead?" you asked yourself. At least I
        have the freedom to do whatever I want now. No constraints. Just like G. </p>

    <p> You do whatever you want. But you can say this is can be an eternal torture. To have no human connection. But
        there's nothing you can do about it. </p>
