    <p> You decide to take the risk that you didn't take the first time. After all, opportunities present themselves to
        those who take them.
        You open the door to see a cloaked figure that was dripping wet from head to toe. The stranger quickly rushed
        inside pushing you out the way. "Sorry," he says. "I needed to hide from the rain." </p>

    <p> He was fully covered in a cloak that covered his face all the way down to his knees. The cloak
        was ragged as if it has stood the testament of time and precipitation. The traveler stood at the same
        height as you. He gave off a gentle aura: one that was seemed to be truthful in nature. </p>

    <p> You welcome this person inside, sat him down, and prepared a nice hot cup of tea to warm him up. When the
        stranger
        took off his cloak to drink, you were shocked by how young he looked. Perhaps, young and old can't seem to
        describe
        the stature of his face. His hair and beard, both white in color, were overgrown all over the place. Despite all
        this,
        his face was rather free of wrinkles, and looked regal indeed. </p>

    <p> "What brought you to be my place and why are you traveling in this kind of weather?" you asked. </p>

    <p> There was a moment of awkward silence as the mysterious person finished drinking the tea. He let out
        a sigh and began to talk. "Thank you. My name is FriedSieg and I'm on a quest. It's an important quest
        after all and I can't let a storm slow me down. Now that this tempest has escalated rather quickly,
        I politely ask for your hospitality." </p>

    <p> "What an interesting request that is. Should I allow it?" </p>
