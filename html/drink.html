    <p> You drink the liquid which tasted horrendous. It was a mixture of a lot of things that
        doesn't go well with each other. It brought you to the point where you thought you were going to vomit.
        To be exact, you are about to vomit. The bartender sensing this, says that you need to
        keep the drink inside of your stomach for the effect to take place. </p>

    <p> "That sucks," you thought, but you obeyed anyway. You are able to swallow the drink back down. Soon enough,
        you no longer harbor any feeling towards whatever abominable you just drank. You had no idea what
        did the drink do, so you ask the bartender. </p>

    <p class="effect"> </p>

    <p> How nice. Marvelous indeed. This is so going to help with the dragon fight later.
        The moment of truth. </p>
