    <p> You quickly run after FriedSieg. "Let me join your adventure. My life is too boring. Please wait for me," you yell after FriedSieg. 
        Hearing this FriedSieg stops and turns around until you are able to catch up with him. "Thank you," you say as you are gasping for air. 

    <p> "Nice of you to join me. It is very reassuring to have another companion on this adventure. I will
        tell you of main objective later. But firstly, I must tell you. This adventure is now yours.
        Entirely in your hand. You are now the protagonist and I am now the mentor or companion," FriedSieg says.</p>

    <p> His words seem to fill you with a sense of destiny. You seem to feel stronger. Stronger, indeed.
        The addition of FriedSieg as an companion increases all your stats by one.</p>

    <p> The two of you head back to your house and begin to take everything from your house, packing it up for an adventure. The packing takes
        all morning. The two of you finally embarks on the journey and heads west at high noon. Soon enough, you encounter
        a fork in the road. "Which path should we take," asks FriedSieg. </p>
