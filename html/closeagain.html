    <p> "It would be better to leave the door closed. The stranger might still be outside," you thought.
        And so you continue with your routine previous to this storm. Once you finished, the thought
        of a mysterious person outside completely vanished from your mind. And so, you headed to sleep. </p>

    <p> While you were asleep, the stranger was able to open the door. Surprisely, the door open rather quietly despite
        how loud everything sounded at night. The stranger began to raid every bit of resource he can from your house.
        Food, utentils,
        and anything else that looks to be of importance to him. He work all night, with the snoring that came out of
        your
        mouth in the background. The Zzzzs were loud and annoying, but nothing seemed to deter him. </p>

    <p> After the stranger was done, he left with everything inside of a big duffel bag. There was quite some time that
        passed when you finally
        woke up in the morning. You found that everything seemed to be gone. There was not a single object in the
        cupboards or in your house. It was quite a shock for
        you have been robbed. Suddenly, a horrible realization dawned over you. "It must have been the stranger from
        yesterday night. He must
        have waited until I have fallen asleep and stripped my house clean," you thought. </p>
