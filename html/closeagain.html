    <p> You think that it would be better to leave the door closed for the stranger might still be outside. 
        And so you continue with your routine previous to this storm. Once you finish, the thought
        of a mysterious person outside completely vanished from your mind. And so, you head to sleep. </p>

    <p> While you are asleep, the stranger was able to open the door. Surprisely, the door opened rather quietly despite
        how loud everything sounded at night. The stranger began to raid every bit of resource he can from your house.
        Food, utentils,
        and anything else that looks to be of importance to him. He works all night, with the snoring that came out of
        your
        mouth in the background. The Zzzzs were loud and annoying, but nothing seemed to deter him. </p>

    <p> After the stranger was done, he left with everything inside of a big duffel bag. There was quite some time that
        passed when you finally
        ake up in the morning. You found that everything seemed to be gone. There is not a single object in the
        cupboards or in your house. It came quite a shock for
        you have been robbed. Suddenly, a horrible realization dawned over you. "It must have been the stranger from
        yesterday night. He must
        have waited until I have fallen asleep and stripped my house clean." </p>
