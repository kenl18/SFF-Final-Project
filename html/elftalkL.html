    <p> "O, great Elf Leader. You have to let us through. We are on a quest for the betterment of 
        everyone in this land." you say with the most soothing voice you can possibly to. FriedSieg can 
        be heard echoing your very word. </p>
    
    <p> "In what way are you improving our lives?" bellow the leader. </p>

    <p> "I'm sure you know that times are changing. We are living in a dark time indeed and I'm trying to fix that." you reply. 
        To be honest, you are bluffing and have no idea what you are talking about. You agreed to go on an adventure with FriedSieg
        and you haven't been told what the mission you are trying to accomplish. A sweat can be seen surfacing 
        on your head as you look at FriedSieg to help make a convincing argument. </p>  

    <p> Due to your low intelligence level, the elf leader misunderstood your statement. He orders his men, or elves if you must say, 
        to take out their bows and arrows. You quickly sense the tension and begin to say a flurry of words in order to resolve the issue. 
        This is also followed by the waving of arms that seem to do nothing but make the high elf more angry. He orders his man to shoot. </p>

    <p> Arrows rained onto the two of you. You and FriedSieg has no way of defending yourself, so they just stood there, accepting their fate. 
        There was some worthwhile memories that you had made with him, and this isn't the end. Hopefully, there is something after death. 
        No traveler returns, but there is something after death. Hopefully. </p>
