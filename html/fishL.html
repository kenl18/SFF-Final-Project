    <p> But firstly you need to get the fire started. You do the primative strategy of starting fire which worked after several attempts. 
        Then, you waded into the water until the water was up to your chest. You took a deep breath and putted your head under water. Right in front of your face, 
        was a decently sized fish for you to eat. You quickly clasp your hands around the fish. The fish bit your finger, causing it to bleed. You quickly let go of the 
        fish. "Hopefully, I don't die from this." you thought while cursing at the fish. </p>

    <p> You tried to catch fish for the rest of the day, but luck was not on your side. Your finger was starting to turn purple, and you were starting to feel dizzy. 
        You just noticed that you had been working for the whole day without rest, water, or food. Unfortunately, you were unable to stop yourself from falling in the ocean 
        and knocking yourself out. </p>

    <p> While you were knocked out, a swarm of fish led by the fish you tried to catch earlier in the day came to you. They began to bite all over your body. The ocean began to 
        be tainted with red liquid as your blood flowed out of you in buckets. You didn't wake up the next day nor as your body able to be found floating in the sea. Perhaps, 
        you have been eaten whole by larger fish or slowly eaten away by smaller carnivorous fish. What bad luck indeed. </p>

    <p> Maybe, in your next life it could be better. </p>
