    <p> You begin to slowly sneak up to secure the goods. Just as your fingers closed around the handle of 
    the basket, the saleperson suddenly turns around. You were caught up in the act. You quickly let go 
    and started running as fast as you can. The saleperson started to screamed for help that he was getting robbed. </p>
    
    <p> Technically, you didn't rob him. You tried to. But nevertheless, someone starts to run after you. Probably
        hoping to capture a criminal for himself and bolster his reputation. His attempt to do so was rather successful as 
        his long legs allows him to catch up to you easily. He quickly tackles you to the floor. </p>

    <p> You try to wrestle free from his weight, but he was too strong. Maybe, too heavy is the right word. The vendor walked up 
        to you with a sly grin on his face. </p>

    <p> "You are in deep trouble, my friend," he said to you. "Do you know the fine for stealing?" You shook your head. </p>

    <p> "Death. That's what awaits you," said the seller as he was beginning to cackle. "Do I get any reward?" asked the capturer. 
        "No! You caught this person, simply because its the right thing to do. Young people, these days. Always asking for a reward," 
        answered the seller. This got the capturer really angry. Angry to the point that he release you and slugged the seller across the face. </p>

    <p> You take this opportunity to run. You didn't get to far before you got hit by a fireball. You fell face first onto the floor as the flames being
        to engulf you. You began to roll in hopes of quenching which worked. You turn around and you see
        that a flaming burned corpse was next to him. Suddenly, vines grip around your legs and prevents you from running. </p>

    <p> "Well, well, well. Look who decided to run. Its a shame that I had to kill that young man. Anyway, it is time for you to die," 
        says the vendor. He brandishes a knife out of this coat and starts to wipe it with a handkerchief. He raises the knife over head and prepares
        to bring it down onto your chest. All of a sudden, a sword stuck out of his chest. A hooded figure had stabbed him. The vendor falls ontop of you dying.
        Behind the hooded figure, the town was on fire. You had been oblivious the whole time, because you are about to die. Even though you had been saved from death,
        you feared your "savior." Wasting no time, he also drives a sword through your chest, killing you too. </p> 

    <p> This is the end of the road now. Evil has been in the works. Maybe, you can do something about it next time. </p>
