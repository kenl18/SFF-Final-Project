    <p> You decide to leave the door closed, despite the continuous knocks. You begin to hear grunts of frustration
        coming from outside. The knocks are soon replaced with the loud noise of someone ramming into the door. Your
        entire home seem to tremble
        as if there is an earthquake happening right now. You took a few steps back in fear that the door is going to
        collapse on top of you, but somehow it stood its place.
    </p>

    <p> What if there was an earthquake happening at the same time of this tumultuous downpour. You decide to hide under
        the table for safety, trembling under the table.
        You hope that this shaking of your house is due to the traveler outside and not because of two disaster in one.
        Eventually, the terrible noise stopped and you breathed a sigh of relief. There was no earthquake after all.
    </p>

    <p> That brought another question. Did the traveler get tired of trying to get inside my house and left? Should you
        take the risk of opening the door and find out? </p>
