    <p> You decide to leave the door closed, despite the continuous knocks. You begin to hear grunts of frustration
        coming from outside. And soon enough, the knocks are replaced with the loud noise of someone ramming into the door. Your
        entire home seem to tremble
        as if there is an earthquake happening right now. You take a few steps back in fear that the door is going to
        collapse on top of you, but somehow it stood its place.
    </p>

    <p> What if there was an earthquake happening at the same time of this tumultuous downpour? So, you decide to hide under
        the table for safety, trembling under it. 
        You hope that this shaking of your house is due to the traveler outside and not because of two disaster happening at once.
        Eventually, the terrible noise stops and you breathe a sigh of relief. There is no earthquake after all.
    </p>

    <p> This brings up another question. Did the traveler get tired of trying to get inside my house and decide to leave? Should you
        take the risk of opening the door and find out? </p>
