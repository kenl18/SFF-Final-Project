    <p> There was a long moment of silence as you ponder this question. </p>

    <p> Eventually, you reply with your answer: "I'm happy to be of service to you. I must tell you I don't have
        much." </p>

    <p> FriedSieg smiles. "Thank you for your kind hospitality," he says, "Let me help you with whatever you need around
        the house." </p>

    <p> The rest of the day went particular smoothly. You are feeling a great sense of euphoria from having a person to
        talk to. The next morning, you awake to news.
        FriedSieg needed to continue on his journey. </p>

    <p> "I can't let any time to be wasted. I'm afraid I must be going. I thank you very much for your kind gesture
        yesterday. Before, I leave I would like to ask you a
        question. If you would like to hear it, of course," he says. </p>

    <p> "I'm all ears," you reply hastily, savoring the last bit of human contact you have for so long </p>

    <p> "Would you like to go on an adventure with me?" </p>
