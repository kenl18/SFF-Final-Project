    <h1> <u> The Beginning </u> </h1>
    <p> You were going about your daily routine in your humble abode, when you suddenly
        heard the crash of thunder. A terrible storm seems to be abrewing. This is quite
        out the ordinary, as this wasn't the season to have any type of bad weather. You
        stare intently outside just as heavy rain begin to fall. </p> <br>

    <p> "How odd. Something must be in the works," you begin to mumble to yourself. </p> <br>

    <p> You return back to what you were doing before, but now with the soft sound of rain.
        Just as you were about to finish, you heard a series of knocks on your door.
        The knocks were so loud that it sounded like thunder itself. </p> <br>

    <p> "Who could it be? There shouldn't be anyone traveling in this weather?
        Perhaps I should let them in," you wondered to yourself. </p>
