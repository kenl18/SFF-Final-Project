    <p> Longing for human contact, you open the door. Two hooded figures walk into your house brandishing swords.
        You quickly back away from them, lifting your hands above your head. "What do you want?" you ask, trembling.
        "Delivering retribution to this land," the two say in unison. "Wh-what did I do to deserve death," you cry.
    </p>

    <p> The two didn't say anything. One of them walk to block the door, preventing you from escaping, while the other
        start to walk towards you. You begin to scream and yell for help, but it does nothing. Time to take matters
        in your own hand. You run towards the door hoping to take the guard by surprise. Unfazed, the guard thrusts his
        sword outwards, straight into your stomach. You charge into guard, knocking him to the ground. </p>

    <p> "I got plot armor," you say. You rip out the weapon out of your stomach, while dodging the partner's attack. You
        drive your sword into the partner's head and doing the same to the guard that laid on the floor. You quickly
        used your bedsheet to cover the wound. But it seems that you have lost too much blood. This is end.
    </p>

    <p> "How pitiful. I should have went on the adventure. Maybe in another life." you said in
        your final moments. You fall ontop of the two guards and the three of you stain the floor with blood. </p>
