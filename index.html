            <h3> Welcome Adventurer </h3>
            <p> Before you begin your journey, pick your preferred race. 
                Each race has 3 stats: strength, intelligence, and luck. 
                The stats will be randomly generated from a range depending on the class. 
            </p>
            <p> This "Choose Your Own Adventure" has RNG aspects. Some choices throughout
                the game will have a chance of success. Some choice will scale off strength,
                intelligence, or luck. The probability and the stat is scales off with will be
                given. Most of the time, it will scale off of strength. (Having higher strength
                will increase the chances of success.) Higher intelligence will increase the amount
                of information that you will get throughout your journey. Luck increases the chance
                of random events
